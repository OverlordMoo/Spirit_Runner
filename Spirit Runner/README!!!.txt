------NOTE-------

The prefabs have decided to not listen
to the "WorldRotation" script after adjusting it.

The infinite world generation needs to be adjusted
so that the rotation can work for touch screens 
(The positions of the objects weren't in the 0 position
 that were already placed in the scene including it's parent.
 the generation needs to be adjusted to work with the new
 positions if necessary).
